# How to get started

There are two ways to run the program: either via IDE (with Gradle) or via standalone archive.

## Running via Gradle task (in IDE)

1. Clone the repository with the following command:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:patrykferenc/snake-libgdx.git
```
2. You can either run it via IDE (IntelliJ IDEA has built in gradle plugin that lets you do this),
or you can do it manually, if you navigate to the root of the project and run:
```
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```
3. The application should be running now, try it out by navigating to the endpoint at:
```
http://localhost:8080/stats
```
where you should see statistics of the default GitHub user [octocat](https://github.com/octocat).
